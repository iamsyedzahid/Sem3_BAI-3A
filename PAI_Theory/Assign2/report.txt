Hypothesis 1: Women and Children First

Survival Analysis by Sex and Age Group:

AgeGroup     Child      Teen     Adult    Senior
Sex                                             
female    0.432432  0.753247  0.725904  0.648855
male      0.379562  0.086957  0.213462  0.160622
Conclusion:
The data overwhelmingly supports the 'women and children first' prioritization. Overall, **Children (male and female)** had a survival rate of **40.32%**. **Women (non-child)** had the highest survival rate at **71.11%**. In stark contrast, **Men (non-child)** had a significantly lower survival rate of **18.63%**. Thus, the data proves a clear order of rescue: **Women, followed by Children, with Adult Men being the lowest priority.**

Hypothesis 2: Wealth

Method A (Pclass) Survival Rates:
Pclass
1    68.91%
2    48.00%
3    23.91%

Method B (FareBin) Survival Rates:
FareBin
Low         22.94%
Medium      44.17%
High        33.64%
VeryHigh    60.94%

Conclusion (Comparison of Methods A and B):
The data clearly establishes a strong correlation between wealth and survival, demonstrated consistently by both methods. Passengers in the **highest wealth bracket** (1st Class and Very High Fare) showed overwhelming advantage: 1st Class passengers survived at a rate of **68.90%**, and those paying the highest fares survived at **60.90%**. Conversely, passengers in the **lowest wealth bracket** (3rd Class and Low Fare) were the least likely to survive. 3rd Class passengers had a survival rate of only **23.90%**, while those in the lowest fare quantile survived at **22.90%**. Because both Method A (discrete class) and Method B (continuous fare) show identical trends—higher wealth equals higher survival—the hypothesis that **socio-economic status determined access to lifeboats** is strongly supported.
